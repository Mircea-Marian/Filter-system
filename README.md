# Filter-system

The purpose of this project is to apply filters to an image. The program breaks down the image into smaller parts and executes the filter operations in its leaf processes much like a map-reduce algorithm and then unifies the results. Firstly, a topology file is given in which the structure of the communication network between the nodes. Then a communication tree is constructed. After that the process of filtering is started.
